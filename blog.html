                <h2>Difference Between Local Storage, Session</h2>
                <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> This read-only interface property provides access to the
                    Document's local storage
                    object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except
                    that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends that is when the page is
                    closed. It is cleared when the last "private" tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for
                    a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).</p>
                <p><strong>Session Storage:</strong> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the
                    sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is
                    that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page
                    session ends.

                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                    valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or
                    the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is
                    created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies.</p>

                <h2>Differences Between Local Scope and Global Scope</h2>
                <p><strong>Global scope </strong>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code
                    blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement,
                    loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global
                    scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</p>
                <p><strong>Local Scope</strong> Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable
                    has local scope.
                    A local variable is only accessible where it's declared.
